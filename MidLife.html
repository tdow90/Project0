        <h2>Patent Clert</h2>
        <p>
          After graduating, Einstein faced major challenges in terms of finding academic positions, having alienated some professors over not attending class more regularly in lieu of studying independently. 

          Einstein eventually found steady work in 1902 after receiving a referral for a clerk position in a Swiss patent office. While working at the patent office, Einstein had the time to further explore ideas that had taken hold during his studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and thus cemented his theorems on what would be known as the principle of relativity.

          In 1905—seen by many as a "miracle year" for the theorist—Einstein had four papers published in the Annalen der Physik, one of the best-known physics journals of the era. Two focused on the photoelectric effect and Brownian motion. The two others, which outlined E=MC2 and the special theory of relativity, were defining for Einstein’s career and the course of the study of physics.
        </p>
        <h2>Nobel Prize for Physics</h2>
        <p>
          In 1921, Einstein won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, since his ideas on relativity were still considered questionable. He wasn't actually given the award until the following year due to a bureaucratic ruling, and during his acceptance speech, he still opted to speak about relativity.

          In the development of his general theory, Einstein had held onto the belief that the universe was a fixed, static entity, aka a "cosmological constant," though his later theories directly contradicted this idea and asserted that the universe could be in a state of flux. 

          Astronomer Edwin Hubble deduced that we indeed inhabit an expanding universe, with the two scientists meeting at the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles in 1931.
        </p>
        <h2>Inventions and Discoveries</h2>
        <p>
          As a physicist, Einstein had many discoveries, but he is perhaps best known for his theory of relativity and the equation E=MC2, which foreshadowed the development of atomic power and the atomic bomb.

          Theory of Relativity
          Einstein first proposed a special theory of relativity in 1905 in his paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” taking physics in an electrifying new direction. By November 1915, Einstein completed the general theory of relativity. Einstein considered this theory the culmination of his life research. 

          He was convinced of the merits of general relativity because it allowed for a more accurate prediction of planetary orbits around the sun, which fell short in Isaac Newton’s theory, and for a more expansive, nuanced explanation of how gravitational forces worked. 

          Einstein's assertions were affirmed via observations and measurements by British astronomers Sir Frank Dyson and Sir Arthur Eddington during the 1919 solar eclipse, and thus a global science icon was born. 


          Einstein’s E=MC2
          Einstein’s 1905 paper on the matter/energy relationship proposed the equation E=MC2: the energy of a body (E) is equal to the mass (M) of that body times the speed of light squared (C2). This equation suggested that tiny particles of matter could be converted into huge amounts of energy, a discovery that heralded atomic power. 

          Famed quantum theorist Max Planck backed up the assertions of Einstein, who thus became a star of the lecture circuit and academia, taking on various positions before becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (today is known as the Max Planck Institute for Physics) from 1917 to 1933.

        <h2 id="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p>
          Three great theories define our physical knowledge of the universe: relativity, quantum mechanics and gravitation. The first is the handiwork of German-born Albert Einstein (1879-1955), who remains the physicist with the greatest reputation for originality of thought. His work showed that space and time are not immutable but are fluid and malleable. Einstein, who took US citizenship in 1940, also provided the world with its most famous equation, E=mc2, which demonstrates the equivalence of mass and energy. His name has become synonymous with the idea of genius and he died a celebrity. He was awarded the 1921 Nobel prize for physics.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</h2>
        <p>
          Co-inventor of calculus, a major contributor to the science of optics and a gifted mathematician, Isaac Newton (1643-1727), who was born in Lincolnshire, outlined the laws of mechanics that now underpin vast swaths of classical physics. Most important of all, Newton outlined the principle of gravity, which explained how the planets revolve round the sun. During his life, he was showered with honours, including the presidency of the Royal Society. He is renowned as a supreme rationalist, though he actually wrote more about alchemy and religion, including a 300,000-word treatise that attempted to prove the pope was really the Antichrist and an “apocalyptic whore”.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Copenhagen, Bohr (1885-1962) developed the modern idea of an atom, which has a nucleus at the centre with electrons revolving round it. When electrons move from one energy level to another, they emit discrete quanta of energy. The work won Bohr a Nobel prize in 1922. For his achievements, Carlsberg brewery gave Bohr a special gift: a house with a pipeline connected to its brewery next door, thus providing him with free beer for life. In 1954, Bohr helped establish Cern, the European particle physics facility. In 1975, his son, Aage, won a Nobel for research on atomic nuclei.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Pisa, Galileo (1564-1642) initially trained as a doctor. On hearing of the invention of the telescope in 1609, he built his own and turned it to the heavens, revealing the existence of sunspots and a pitted, mountainous surface on the moon: the heavens were not incorruptible. His studies also provided support for the idea that the Earth revolves round the sun. This got Galileo into considerable trouble with the Catholic church and he was forced to abandon that backing in 1633. His work on falling bodies also laid the groundwork for Newton’s subsequent theories.
        </p>
        <h2 id="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</h2>
        <p>
          In contrast to Newton and Einstein, Edinburgh-born Maxwell (1831-79) is virtually unknown to the general public. Yet his contribution to physics was every bit as significant, particularly his discovery of the theory of electromagnetism. This showed that electricity, magnetism and light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon, the electromagnetic field. The development of radio, TV and radar were the direct consequences. Maxwell also carried out pioneering work in optics and colour vision. However, in his later years, his God-fearing Scottish upbringing brought him into dispute with the evolutionary thinking of Darwin and others and he wrote papers denouncing natural selection.
